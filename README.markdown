The goal is to to be a sproutcore framework that makes it really easy to use persevere with SproutCore.

If I can find a good example I'd like to remove all the directly hierarchy so you don't have to go into
sproutcore-persevere/frameworks/persevere to get to the actual framework.

You can run the tests by:

1. run "sc-server" in the root of the project.
2. open a browser to http://localhost:4020/persevere/en/current/tests.html
